Here are the steps to push your project from VS Code to your GitHub repository:

---

### **Step 1: Install Git**
Ensure that Git is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [Git's official site](https://git-scm.com/).

---

### **Step 2: Configure Git**
1. Open a terminal in VS Code.
2. Set your Git username and email if not already configured:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "YourName"
   git config --global user.email "YourEmail@example.com"
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Initialize a Git Repository**
1. Navigate to your project directory in VS Code's terminal.
2. Initialize Git in your project folder:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

---

### **Step 4: Link the Remote Repository**
1. Add your GitHub repository as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/mdshahbaz7434/DataGenZabist.git
   ```

---

### **Step 5: Add Files to Staging Area**
1. Stage all files in your project directory:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   (The `.` stages all files. Replace with specific file names if needed.)

---

### **Step 6: Commit the Changes**
1. Commit your changes with a meaningful message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

---

### **Step 7: Push to GitHub**
1. Push the changes to the main branch:
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

### **Step 8: Verify on GitHub**
1. Visit your repository link: [DataGenZabist](https://github.com/mdshahbaz7434/DataGenZabist.git).
2. Ensure all files are uploaded successfully.

---

### **Optional Steps: Using VS Code Source Control**
1. Open the **Source Control** tab in VS Code (the third icon in the left sidebar).
2. Stage, commit, and push changes directly using the GUI.
